# Hello
Hello all, welcome! Here is a dummy project to give you an idea of how we'll be organizing projects in this course. Check it out, and we'll discuss in class.

Your task in this assignment is simple:
* Add your name to the call for greeting and check by invoking greet.
* Add a test to make sure the greeting is more than just the name (HINT: there is an assertNotEqual()) and test.

Once you've done, commit and push to GitHub. Remember this involves:
* git remote add origin https://github.com/pcc-cs003c-summer-2018/hello-allurefx (you need to do this only once)
* git add \<files you changed>
* git commit -m \<your message>
* git push origin master (you will be asked to log into your GitHub account)
